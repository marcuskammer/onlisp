adopted from the online free version from https://code.google.com/archive/p/onlisp/.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
On Lisp is a comprehensive study of advanced Lisp techniques, with bottom-up
programming as the unifying theme. It gives the first complete description of
macros and macro applications. The book also covers important subjects related
to bottom-up programming, including functional programming, rapid prototyping,
interactive development, and embedded languages. The final chapter takes a
deeper look at object-oriented programming than previous Lisp books, showing the
step-by-step construction of a working model of the Common Lisp Object System
(CLOS).

As well as an indispensable reference, On Lisp is a source of software. Its
examples form a library of functions and macros that readers will be able to use
in their own Lisp programs.
